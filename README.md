CardSharks Game, info on project in ReadMe

Assignment: 

Many moons ago there was a game show called Card Sharks. The most gripping part of the game was when contestants were given a playing card and asked to guess whether the next one from the deck would be higher or lower (I was young, don't judge). If they successfully guessed five times in a row then they won the match. If they guessed incorrectly at any point they lost the match. Recreate a web-based version of Card Sharks for the world to enjoy.

Focus primarily on functionality on this project, though feel free to spend time on improving the design as well.

Display a card when the page first loads, and give users a "higher" and "lower" button. When they click, a new card should be chosen and displayed along with the player's guess. If the player was correct they should be able to guess again. If they were wrong then they should lose the round.
The same card should not be able to come up more than once in a single match.
